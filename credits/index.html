            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <p>This website was created by UsernameFodder (if it wasn't already evident by the footer). The markup, styling, and scripting were all done from scratch, because why not?</p>
            
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>The original sources of the questions and descriptions used for this quiz are the following Pokémon Mystery Dungeon (PMD) games:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red/Blue Rescue Team</li>
                    <li>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness</li>
                    <li>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Modifications from the Source</h2>
            <p>Minor modifications were made in a very limited number of cases.
                <ul>
                    <li>A "Neither" option was added to the final "gender question" of the quiz.</li>
                    <li>The Hasty nature's description from PMD: Rescue Team was changed to reference the "Next" button rather than the "A" button.</li>
                    <li>Certain questions from PMD: Explorers of Sky are almost identical to questions from PMD: Explorers of Time/Darkness, up to minor phrasing differences. This quiz keeps phrasing consistent between games. Which of the two variants were used varies by question, depending on which I liked better.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Response Point Values</h2>
            <p>
                The nature point values for responses were taken from various websites and cross-referenced for accuracy. Among them:
