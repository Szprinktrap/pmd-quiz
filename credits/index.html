            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <p>This website was created by UsernameFodder. The markup, styling, and scripting were all done from scratch, because why not?</p>
            
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>The original sources of the questions, answers, and nature descriptions used for this quiz are the following Pokémon Mystery Dungeon (PMD) games:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red/Blue Rescue Team</li>
                    <li>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness</li>
                    <li>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Response Point Values</h2>
            <p>
                The nature point values for responses were taken from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18utO_lCpWQ7iXY9wpbtxXpgmzebEI2IRjADp6IrUKZ0/view#gid=0">PMD Info Spreadsheet</a>, created and verified by the researcher <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShinxHijinx">ShinxHijinx</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Modifications from the Source</h2>
            <p>All text was kept as close as possible to that of the original games, but minor modifications were made in a very limited number of cases. Response point values for certain questions were modified where appropriate. See the <a href="../details">details</a> page for more information.</p>

            <h2>Font</h2>
            <p>The lovely Mystery Dungeon font used for this site is a modified version of the <a href="https://www.dafont.com/wonder-mail.font">Wonder Mail</a> font, which was "painstakingly assembled by hand" by ShinxHijinx. I modified a few characters ('O', 'o', '8', '%', '♂', and '♀' to be specific) that weren't rendering properly in the original font.</p>

            <h2>Sprites</h2>
            <p>Sprites from the PMD: Explorers games were used. They were taken from <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/">the Spriter's Resource website</a>. Direct links:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/pokemonmysterydungeonexplorersoftimedarkness/">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/pokemonmysterydungeonexplorersofsky/">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky</a></li>
